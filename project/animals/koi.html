                 <p>Kois are omnivores which means they mostly eat plants and bugs. In the wild they algae, insects, worms, seeds, and other plants and bugs.
                    Which is they're main source of food. They also sometimes eat other fish eggs and dead animals and plants. THey can be found to eat any food in area of their body of water from surface to 
                    depths of their pond. When it comes to domesticated koi they're diet can go from types of fish food like Spirulina Algae (Fish Food pellet that uses algae) and Brine Shrimp(Very small Shrimp that's been bio-enriched). But with a koi's diet 
                    any carbohydrates isn't good for the koi because they have a hard time digesting those types of foods.  </p>

                      <p>A wild Koi's habitat is freshwater bodies. It is found mostly in the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, and Aral Sea.
                        Sometimes Koi would migrate in flooded areas to their freashwater areas to lay their eggs. 
                        With the Koi being domesticated it now lives all over the world in diffierent types of freshwater ponds.
                        In the case of UCSC, the school has a Koi pond habitat at Porter College.</p>

                      <p>When it comes to the a Koi's inner biology it has a few different parts. Starting with the swimbladder
                        which is located near the top of the koi's body. It helps the koi with it's movement from the depths of the water as well as making so the koi uses less energy while swimming <br>.
                        The part is the gills it's main point is respiration for the koi, as it allows oxygen to flow to the koi's body using the water around. <br>
                        With the heart of the koi it similar to ours as it pumps blood with oxygen from the gills to the rest of our body. <br>
                        The Liver of the Koi breaks anything unwanted from the food it eats like toxins and proteins that's not needed. <br>
                        The Gonads are the koi's reproduction organs that store either eggs or sperm.
                        The Vent where the waste of the koi's system exits out from. <br>
                        With the Spleen it the main area of producing cells for the immune system of the koi <br>
                      </p>
