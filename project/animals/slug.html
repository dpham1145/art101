                 <p>Banana slugs are mostly herbivores as well as decomposers, they eat almost anything plant-based. 
                    From leaves, roots, stems, flowers, seeds and fruits. They also sometimes eat poison oak while most animals try to avoid poison oaks banana slugs have no problem eating it. 
                    Banana slugs will also eat different types of fungi like most mushrooms. Sometimes banana slugs will also eat animal feces and and dead organic matter like dead leaves. But for the most part, Banana slugs eat anything that's plants. </p>

                      <p>The habitat of the Banana Slugs is forests that are dense and moist. Found on leaves and the wet floor of the forest. They can be found in the Pacific Northwest from Central California to Alaska. 
                        They can be found around our school especially on damp days after rain. </p>

                      <p>So the anatomy of a banana has many different elements. 
                        One of the key points of the Banana slug is the pneumostome where it holds its respiratory pore, lung, and reproductive organs. 
                        The gonopore is another part that gives life to the banana slug, it's where its eggs exit. Now with its tentacles, the upper ones are for seeing and smelling. While the lower ones are for taste and feeling, with the radula being the slug's mouth.</p>
