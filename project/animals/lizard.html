                 <p>These lizards eat a large variety of different arthropods and insects. A few examples of these would be beetles, mites, ants, spiders, 
                    scorpions, and sow bugs. They will rarely ever hunt because they feed opportunistically on any insect that passes near them. Their 
                    feeding habits are also influenced by sex, season, and body temperature. They will also occasionally eat plants if they urgently 
                    need water.</p>

                      <p>The habitat of these creatures varies widely, ranging from arid biomes with scattered bushes to sandy areas with lots of rocks. 
                        They tend to gravitate toward sandier ecosystems with lots of rocks because they bask on rocks in order to get their body temperature
                        up.

                      <p>The common side-blotched lizard is native to dry regions and can be found throughout western United States and northern 
                        Mexico. They are a small species of lizard and usually only reach 2.4 inches in length. Some distinguishing characteristics 
                        in males are the blue flecks spread across their body or their yellow and orange sides. Females tend to have stripes along 
                        their body or could be unpatterned. 

                        Their mating follows a “rock-paper-scissors mechanism” where the differences in each male's throat color plays a large role in 
                        how they compete for mates. The three morphs seen in these lizards are orange throated males, blue throated males, and yellow 
                        throated males. The cycle seen every year is that the least common morph will have the largest number of mature living offspring 
                        in the next year. With studies done recently, this can be summarized as “orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange", 
                        which is similar to the rules of rock-paper-scissors.”  In turn, orange throated females tend to produce larger amounts of eggs, meanwhile 
                        yellow throated females lay fewer, yet larger, eggs.
