         <p>Our project will be called “UCSC Animals Generator.” Our project’s function is to provide 
            random animals for users to read into. Each animal will have a dedicated page to them along with 
            4 sub-sections. These sub-sections include more information about an animal as well as a list of
            other animals. These are labeled: diet, habitat, bio, and list. If the user is indecisive about 
            what animal they want to read about, there will be a random animal button in the lower middle of the page.</p>
